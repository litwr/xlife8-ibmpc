              SHORT INFORMATION ABOUT NOTEPAD+4 IBM PC EDITION
This program is an attempt to make a simple plain text editor which may use the same commands as the build-in full-screen Basic (3.5, 4.0+, 7.0) editor for Commodore CBM II, 16, 116, +4,  128.  The other aim is to work with a text file with any line length.  The length of the current line is more than 600 characters.  It is not intended to work with the control ASCII symbols of ANSI.SYS or MS-DOS.  It may work with up to 600 lines of text.  This number may be increased.  The end of a paragraph is marked as the end of the document.  This editor supports standard Commodore Esc-sequences - they should start with TAB key:

  A/C - toggles insert/overwrite mode, default is insert mode;

  D/I - deletes/inserts a line;

  J/K - moves cursor to the start/end of current line;

  P/Q - erases text from cursor to the start/end of current line;

  V/W - scrolls up/down;

  X - cancels Esc-sequence as well as any other key.

There are also several commands specific to Notepad+4.  They are associated with CONTROL key:

  B/E - moves cursor to the start/end of the document;

  C - shows disk catalog and gives possibility to choose a file to load;

  D - changes directory;

  F - seeks forward for a string.  The search is case insensitive.  It is a bit slow;

  P - shows command summary;

  L/S - saves/loads a file;

  N - starts a new document;

  Q - quit;

  R - repeats the search;

  V - changes disk drive.

Enter key splits the current line.  Insert key inserts the spaces.  Use cursor, Page Up/Down, Backspace and Delete keys as usual.  Home and End keys moves cursor to the upper left and lower right corner of the screen respectively.  Save your text often because it is possible that several bugs are still not catched.
