\bNAME

 \gXlife - Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata for the IBM  PC  with
Intel 8088 CPU and CGA graphics. It is for DOS compatible OS with ANSI.SYS  dri-
ver installed.

\bDESCRIPTION

 \gThe program helps the user play with John Horton Conway's "Life" game.

\bCOMMANDS

 \x!  Place random cells on the area of the universe on the screen.
 \x%  Set a percentage density for a randomly filled area.  Default is 42%.
 \x+  Zoom the view in.  This mode is faster for big patterns and slower  for  the
    small ones.
 \x-  Zoom the view out.
 \x.  Place the cursor to the center of the universe.
 \x?  Help for xlife.
 \xB  Benchmark.  Enter a number of generations and get time. This also provides a
    way for the fastest evolution.
 \xC  Clear the universe.
 \xE  Toggle pseudocolor display mode.  In this mode, new cells are shown  in  the
    extra color.  It is slightly slower.
 \xg  Toggle running the game.  Evolve/Stop.  Then step through generations  until
    something exceptional happens, like no live cells or a key pressed.
 \xh  (Hide) stop  displaying  after  each generation.  This mode  is  up  to  10%
    faster than established by g-command in the zoomed out mode.
 \xl  Load (actually add) pattern  to  the universe from a  file.  This  lets  you
    overlay multiple saved states to make for some interesting  effects.  Loaded
    pattern is (default) initially considered tentative, and  maybe  manipulated
    in various ways before incorporating it into  main  pattern.   (To  indicate
    this, it's  surrounded by a bounding box.)  Clear the  universe if you  want
    to start from scratch. It is possible either to select a pattern in the dir-
    ectory list directly or to enter a pattern name.  A file may only  be  taken
    from a \pPATTERNS\g subdirectory of the root directory on any disk.
 \xL  Immediately reload, at the cursor, a copy of the  last  pattern  loaded.  It
    doesn't work for ramdisk patterns.
 \xo  Forward one generation.
 \xQ  Quit.
 \xR  Change the (2-state) rules in "stays alive on" / "born  on".   The  standard
    rules are 23/3 (alive on two or three neighbors, birth  on  three  neighbors
    for an empty cell).
 \xS  Save the universe to a file.  It is correct to save to an existed  file  but
    no warning message is provided.
 \xT  Set up the topology.  It is possible to use the rectangular  area  with  the
    connected edges (anchor ring, tore) or the rectangular plain.
 \xv  View current pattern information.
 \xV  View comments to a file.
 \xX  Reload palette from the file "colors.cfg".  This file is loaded automatical-
    ly when the program starts.
 \xZ  Set and optionally save a palette.

 Use (\rshift\n\g +) \rcursor\n\g, \rHome\n\g,  and \r.\n\g keys to move the cursor.  Use  \rspace bar\n\g  to
 change the cell under cursor.

\bSTATUS BAR

 \gIt shows the number of generations,  the total sum of live cells, the  slowness
 indicator (100% means the maximum slowness), the rules,  and the  cursor  coor-
 dinates.

\bLIMITS

 \gIt is possible to see only up to 999 files from the disk directory.  Use a mask
 to show only matched files.

 The tentative pattern may show only up to 1536 cells.  The other cells are  not
 shown but loaded later.  This quantity is enough to show every cell from a pat-
 tern file with the size that is equal approximately to 3 KB.

 The universe size is 248x192.

 The rules with "born on" condition 0 are not supported.

 Files on ramdisk are without comments.

\bFORMATS

 \gThe first two bytes of a pattern file are its width and height.  The  next  two
 bytes describes "stay alive on" condition,  and the next  two - "born on".  The
 next contents are the sequence of X and Y coordinate pairs of live  cells.  The
 patterns must have \p8XL\g filename extension.

 A file with comments must have the same name as the corresponding pattern file-
 name. A comment file is a common plain text file.  It may be edited by any text
 text editor.

\bUsing the "lifeconv" utility

 \gThis utility  from Xlife  main  sources may convert CELLS, LIF, L, RLE, and MCL
 formats. It may be used from any relative to Unix OS or from Microsoft Windows.
 The \plifeconv\g utility takes a pattern name as an argument.  It writes a file  to
 standard output that contains an equivalent version of the pattern in a  diffe-
 rent format.  Usage is:

   \plifeconv pattern -4 >destination\g

 where destination is any valid file name.  The "-4" option sets the format  for
 8-bit Xlife for the destination file is written.  In  Microsoft  Windows  envi-
 ronment (Mingw Xlife port) the sign \p>\g must be omitted.

 A file produced may be directly used with the IBM PC.  The appropriate  comment
 file should have the same name as \p8xl\g-file, the \ptxt\g-extension,  and its content
 may be any textual data.


\bRAMDISK

 \gIt contains 10 patterns:

\pglider gun\g  The Gosper glider gun is the first known gun, and indeed  the  first
        known finite pattern with unbounded growth, found by Bill Gosper in Nov-
        ember 1970.

\psmall fish\g the lightweight spaceship (or LWSS) is the smallest orthogonally mov-
        ing spaceship, and the second  most common spaceship.  Random soups will
        emit one LWSS for approximately every 615 gliders.  It moves at c/2  and
        has period 4.

\pHWSS\g    the heavyweight spaceship is the fourth most common ship.

\pr-pentomino\g a methuselah that was found by John Conway in 1970. It is by far the
        most active polyomino with fewer than six cells; all of the others  sta-
        bilize in at most 10 generations, but the  R-pentomino does  not  do  so
        until generation 1103, by which time it has a population  of  116.   The
        glider it releases in generation 69, was the  first  glider ever  obser-
        ved.

\pbunnies\g, \plidka\g, \pacorn\g methuselahs with 17332,  29055,  5206 generations lifespan
        respectively.

\pbig glider\g The big glider was found by Dean Hickerson in December 1989  and  was
        the first known  diagonal spaceship other than the glider. 

\pbi-gun\g  a double-barreled glider gun, a glider generator.  It produces two  gli-
        ders for 46 generations.

\pblock-laying switch engine\g  a puffer train which travels diagonally at c/12  to-
        wards the  upper left with a period of 96.  This is the  smallest  known
        object which grows without bound. It produces eight new blocks every 288
        generations.

\bEXPLORATION

\g Here are some 2-state rules to experiment with:

  \p23/3\g        the default, of course; Conway's "Life" rules.

  \p1234/3\g      patterns "crystallize"

  \p12345/45\g    patterns become contained

  \p12345/4\g     same as above, but settles VERY quickly

  \p5/12\g        floor  tile patterns...  Variations of this tend to be interesting
              as well

  \p1357/1357\g   replicators world...

  \p/2\g          seeds - most patterns expand indefinitely, some interesting  ones.
              Fast gliders.

  \p012345678/3\g life without  death.  Ladders.

\bFILES

  \pcolors.cfg\g   this file contains the palette. It's a binary file.  May be omit-
              ted.

  \pcr.txt\g       the text file with copyright and historical  information.  Should
              not be omitted!
